# Weather Image Classifer 

## Abstract 
This project predicts the weather of the image which is implemented with the help of Fast.ai library based on Pytorch 

## Algorithms Implemented 
<ul>
	<li>Convolution Neural Network's architecture RESNET34 with 96.889 % accuracy </li>
	<li>Convolution Neural Network's architecture RESNET0 with 98.222 % accuracy</li>
</ul>

## Best Model 
RESNET50 is working slightly better than RESNET34
